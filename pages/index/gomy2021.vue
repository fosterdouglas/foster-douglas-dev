            As always, my "game of the year" lists include any games I played
            this year, not only 2021's new releases. It's always more important
            for me to enjoy, celebrate, and highlight notable experiences
            generally than to arbitrarily rush to play the newest games.

        For me, 2021 was the year of indie gaming. At the start of the year, I
        made myself a goal to play 2 indie games per week (or average 2-per-week
        by the end of the year at least). My definition of indie was loose, but
        in most cases the games are at least an hour or more in length,
        generally (but not always) have an "end" state of some sort, and are
        considered "indie" by the generally accepted definition (not published
        by a large company, a moderate budget and team size, etc). I achieved
        the goal just barely, and played 105 total indie games (wow!), although
        I will say that it didn't feel like a "difficult" goal to achieve
        necessarily because of how varied and short the experiences were each
        week. This gives rise to a "Notable Indies" portion of the list below,
        which I think will be recurring in future lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as a result, I played a good amount less "AAA" games in 2021, which
        was a necessary trade off. Generally speaking, I prefer indie games
        anyway, so I don't feel remorse about this. Below are quick blurbs on
        the notable experiences I had this year. Many of them are incomplete
        thoughts, or too-late recollections of thoughts I had during the
        original playthroughs (many months ago for some), but I try to give a
        general gist of why, to me, it's worth putting on a list:
      </p>

      <h2>
        <mark>Notable Indies</mark>
      </h2>
      <h4 class="bold">Ikenfell</h4>
      <h6>Happy Ray Games</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/ikenfell.gif'" />
      <p>
        I played this early in the year, but I remember being wholly charmed by
        it. It has a unique turn-based combat system that feels like a
        simplified variation on <i>Paper Mario</i> and <i>Tactics</i> games, and
        the characters and narrative were memorable and interesting. If I were a
        kid now, I could even see myself enjoying it as much as I enjoyed
        <i>Chrono Trigger</i> as a kid (although of course
        <i>Chrono Trigger</i> is more seminal in every way, that distinction
        might be subtle to younger audiences).
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Chicory: A Colorful Tale</h4>
      <h6>Greg Lobanov, Finji</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/chicory-a-colorful-tale.gif'" />
      <p>
        This game wears its 2D <i>Zelda</i> inspirations proudly on its sleeve,
        and in certain aspects it actually succeeds in ways that the 2D
        <i>Zelda</i> games don't entirely. Which is to say with its storytelling
        and emotional heart. It has much less "combat" (but by no means
        completely absent of conflict and tension), and I love the focus on
        character interaction and how unique the painting mechanic is. It's not
        just another hero carrying a sword and shield, but a vulnerable and
        grounded protagonist who grows with the player. Weirdly similar to my
        comment on <i>Ikenfell</i>, I could absolutely see this being an
        inspirational game for someone younger, and that in the future they
        would look back fondly on playing it as a child. If the Games of the
        Year section wasn't so packed already, this game would have probably
        made it there.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">TOEM</h4>
      <h6>Something We Made</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/toem.gif'" />
      <p>
        A game all about taking photos. It's so charming, so easy to play and
        "cozy" feeling, has a great mix of limited exploration and satisfying
        collectibles, and the perfect overall length. Pulling off black and
        white seems so tricky normally but it pulls it off with distinction and
        is the perfect choice for the game, both visually and conceptually for a
        game based around photography to focus on composition and reference the
        roots of the medium.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</h4>
      <h6>Ustwo, Plug In Digital</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/alba-a-wildlife-adventure.gif'" />
      <p>
        Another... game all about taking photos. This game hit me in some
        interesting ways, and I was surprised at how it had a purpose and
        "mission" beyond the game itself (broadly, it's about wildlife
        preservation), and how it gently preaches that mission to the player.
        It's also really interesting to play directly as a child, and I don't
        think most games that try this really pull it off but here its done with
        a lot of whimsy and care.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Everything</h4>
      <h6>David OReilly</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/everything.gif'" />
      <p>
        In some ways, this sometimes barely feels like a "game," and in other
        ways I consider it as a contender for best of the year. It's a great
        example of effective organic exploration design. It's also in the rare
        category of explicitly incorporating philosophy in its narrative, and
        the even rarer category of that philosophy being delivered directly by
        Alan Watts. As with all the games in the Games of the Year group, even
        though this one isn't, I could absolutely see replaying this some day in
        the future, if for no other reason than an excuse to listen to a couple
        of hours of Alan Watts philosophize over top a
        <i>Katamari</i>-infused universe simulator.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Void Bastards</h4>
      <h6>Blue Manchu</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/void-bastards.gif'" />
      <p>
        It's hard to pinpoint exactly why I enjoyed this game so much. I do know
        that all the systems feel exactly as complex as they need to be, and
        that the gameplay loop is challenging but fair and varied enough to stay
        interesting for the 10 hours or so it takes to finish a single run. The
        humor and art style are also spot on.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>
        <mark>Notable Strategy</mark>
      </h2>
      <h4 class="bold">Desperadoes III</h4>
      <h6>Mimimi Games</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/desperadoes-3.gif'" />
      <p>
        The strategy game design was both satisfyingly open-ended, allowing
        dozens of solutions to any given area, while also still retaining
        direction and momentum forward. I found myself often surprised at how
        creative I could be, and sometimes needed to be, to get through certain
        sections and accomplish some of the optional goals too. Also
        surprisingly, the narrative was quite interesting, though not
        ground-breaking, and felt like a step forward from their previous title,
        <i>Shadow Tactics</i>.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Into the Breach</h4>
      <h6>Subset Games</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/into-the-breach.gif'" />
      <p>
        From the people that did <i>FTL</i>, this is a thoughtful experience
        with meticulously designed turn-based strategy and endless variation. I
        only played through the game once, despite the game heavily encouraging
        multiple playthroughs. That's actually my only complaint with the game,
        that it could have maybe strung together a few sets of the 4 islands to
        create something more like a standard campaign to play through, instead
        of individual disconnected runs. Regardless, one of the best modern
        strategy games I've maybe ever played.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Frostpunk</h4>
      <h6>11 Bit Studios</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/frostpunk.gif'" />
      <p>
        A complex and tense game with a pretty narrow design for viable
        strategies, but still a lot fun regardless. In particular, the "prequel"
        DLC that was released was my favorite scenario of the lot because it
        deviated the most from the rest of the game's stricter style. I'm glad
        the game was successful enough to warrant a sequel eventually, which was
        recently announced. I'm also very excited for the board game adaptation
        that's coming.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Slay the Spire</h4>
      <h6>Mega Crit Games</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/slay-the-spire.gif'" />
      <p>
        In the category of "rougelike" games with loads of relics to collect to
        then use to break the rules, this game lives next to the greatest games
        of this style like <i>Dead Cells</i> , <i>The Binding of Isaac</i> , and
        <i>Risk of Rain</i>, except... it's a card-based strategy game. It's
        since paved the way for an entire genre of card-action games (which are
        distinct from what <i>Hearthstone</i> does, I think). I played it much
        less than I was tempted to, but I did play through to the end boss with
        the three primary classes and thoroughly enjoyed its deep mechanics.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <mark>Most Addictive</mark>
      </h2>
      <h4 class="bold">Planet Coaster</h4>
      <h6>Fontier Developments</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/planet-coaster.gif'" />
      <p>
        This was my Pandemic comfort game, for sure. I put 100 hours into it
        (generally rare for me for a single game), and really enjoyed creating
        coasters and micromanaging the aspects of the parks and employees. It
        feels like an optimized balance loop between strategy and creativity,
        creating something unique in your park and seeing how that affects the
        ecosystem and then adapting and doing that process over and over again.
        It feels like a worthy successor to the
        <i>Rollercoaster Tycoon</i> series, and is actually a better experience
        in most ways.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Two Point Hospital</h4>
      <h6>Two Point Studios</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/two-point-hospital.gif'" />
      <p>
        Similarly, this game is clearly inspired by Bullfrog's classic
        <i>Theme Hospital</i> from the 90s, a goofy-in-tone but serious-strategy
        hospital management sim. This game takes that goofy tone even further,
        which works really well. My only complaint with the experience is that
        once you realize how important the room decorations that level up each
        room in the hospital are, it feels like you can get through things a lot
        easier in ways that maybe didn't feel intended in the design. I'm
        definitely looking forward to the team's university-themed follow-up
        this year, <i>Two Point Campus</i>.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <mark>Notable Co-Op</mark>
      </h2>
      <h4 class="bold">Ashen</h4>
      <h6>A44</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/ashen.gif'" />
      <p>
        During the first boss of this, I was worried that we weren't cut out for
        this type of game, but after some practice it ended up being very
        satisfying. It implements co-op in a nice way, slightly more intuitively
        than FromSoftware games generally do. The art style and world design is
        really satisfying and simple, and exploring some of the nooks and
        crannies of the moderately-sized open world felt rewarding.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Sackboy: A Big Adventure</h4>
      <h6>Sumo Digital</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/sackboy-a-big-adventure.gif'" />
      <p>
        This was a complete joy to play local co-op, and felt like a really nice
        transition for Sackboy from side-scrolling to 3D adventure. It feels as
        though a lot of the structural groundwork was laid with
        <i>Tearaway</i>, although I know a separate developer did most of the
        work on this entry.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Fallout 76</h4>
      <h6>Bethesda Softworks</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/fallout-76.gif'" />
      <p>
        I consider myself a mild Fallout fan, although I've recently realized
        that I've played <i>Fallout 3</i> , <i>New Vegas</i> , <i>Shelter</i> ,
        <i>Fallout 4</i> , and now <i>Fallout 76</i>, so maybe I like the series
        more than I think I do. I might have had a little more fun with this
        than Lance did, especially because I did most of the "base building"
        stuff, which I found a lot of enjoyment with. The game's narrative
        builds toward a nice climax and some of the characters are memorable.
        It's worth noting that we played this long after it was released, after
        it had a lot of patches and full-blown content updates that were absent
        at launch.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Embr</h4>
      <h6>Muse Games</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/embr.gif'" />
      <p>
        Adding this here for the sheer novelty factor of the experience. It was
        a lot of fun to play as a firefighter with some cartoon whimsy, and have
        some unique "gadgets" that each firefighter could bring into the field.
        The boss design was pretty poorly done, but luckily there were only a
        few bosses anyway.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Operation: Tango</h4>
      <h6>Clever Plays</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/operation-tango.gif'" />
      <p>
        A surprisingly fun asynchronous game where one person plays as an
        "agent" in the field, while the other person is the tech "hacker" off
        site. It had really fun puzzles, great overall length, and some very
        nicely balanced and lenient failure conditions. It created some of the
        most stressful and hilarious co-op moments of the year, and we actually
        played through it twice to see both sides of each level.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Heroes of Hammerwatch</h4>
      <h6>CrackShell</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/heroes-of-hammerwatch.gif'" />
      <p>
        I was very surprised by how addicting the gameplay loop was for this. A
        given "run" had an interesting difficulty curve that goes from Easy &gt;
        Difficult &gt; Very Difficult &gt; Easy, if you can find enough
        interesting artifacts along the way. It feels very well suited for co-op
        as well, playing it single player seems a lot less dynamic and
        interesting.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Nioh 2</h4>
      <h6>Team Ninja</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/nioh-2.gif'" />
      <p>
        Pretty much an improvement in every way over the first Nioh. One of the
        few games available at 120fps on PS5 near launch, it has some beautiful
        environments and is incredibly silky smooth. It's always interesting to
        dive into these games with complex systems that take some time to fully
        understand, and generally it pays off later on. We enjoyed it enough to
        play the three DLCs as well.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <mark>Most Surprising</mark>

      <h4 class="bold">Tearaway Unfolded</h4>
      <h6>Media Molecule</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/tearaway-unfolded.gif'" />
      <p>
        This has all the charm of a Media Molecule
        <i>Littlebigplanet</i> entry, but as a third-person adventure story. I'm
        not sure why I was so surprised by this, but the game had an incredible
        amount of creativity in how it used the PS4's controller, and how it
        incorporates the "You" (the player) into the game in interesting meta
        ways. Although the game was about twice as long as it needed to be for
        my taste, all of it still feels fresh and innovative throughout.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</h4>
      <h6>Square Enix</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/dq-11s.gif'" />
      <p>
        Having never played a <i>DQ</i> game and sort of insinuating what they'd
        be like based on some random impressions, this game was a massive
        surprise to me (although it may be the case that it is the least
        <i>Dragon Quest</i>-like entry in the series). The production value, and
        in particular the music, is astonishing. It tries a lot of unique things
        and succeeds with most of them, and it really feels like a nice
        evolution or hybridization of a classic JRPG.
      </p>

      <h6>Giant Squid</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/the-pathless.gif'" />
      <p>
        I know that this game is beloved by a lot of fans, and I can definitely
        see why, but to me the game design feels ham-fisted and disjointed. The
        open world is beautiful and moving through it fluidly and "flow"-like
        feels really special. The decision to then make it into an Ubisoft-style
        "activate the towers" game design is a bit disappointing, but not what
        soiled the experience for me. It's the boss design that feels
        unnecessary (although I've seen plenty of discourse heavily praising
        it). It doesn't feel like it fits with the vibe of the world, almost as
        if an executive came in at the end of development and said "this is
        great, but you know what it's missing? BOSSES." So much else about the
        game is experimental that I feel they could have leaned even harder into
        it to better tie it all together for me.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Sayonara Wild Hearts</h4>
      <h6>Simogo</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/sayonara-wild-hearts.gif'" />
      <p>
        Outside of all of the unfortunate controversy around the development
        team on this game, which sullies its appeal as it is, I came away after
        playing it with a weird mix of inspired and frustrated. My primary issue
        with the gameplay is that it doesn't encourage experimentation. The game
        has a notable and stellar soundtrack, and the game feels at its best
        when the player can get into a flow with the music and traverse the
        levels. But, with such strict level design in some cases, you'll find
        yourself replaying sections of levels over and over to get past them.
        While there's nothing wrong with that in theory, being restarted at
        checkpoints feels deeply at odds with the flow of the gameplay style.

      <h6>Graceful Decay</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/maquette.gif'" />
      <p>
        It's easy to sum this up, which is to say a very cool idea executed a
        bit poorly. It's more focused on telling a (heartfelt, for sure)
        sob-story about a breakup someone had than it is concerned with the
        puzzle-designed experience of the player, unfortunately. If this type of
        game is interesting to you, check out
        <i>Superliminal</i>, <i> Manifold Garden</i>, or <i>The Pedestrian</i>,
        just a few of many great games in the puzzle genre that I played in
        2021.

      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/raji-an-ancient-epic.gif'" />
      <p>
        Unfortunately, this experience didn't quite come together for me. The
        controls and combat design are incredibly frustrating, to the extreme
        that it felt borderline unplayable at times personally. The visuals are
        great, and the story-telling style and setting are quite unique and
        distinct, but neither is enough to carry the entire experience.

      <h6>Mobius Digital, Annapurna Interactive</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/outer-wilds-echoes-of-the-eye.gif'" />
      <p>
        This doesn't technically belong in this section, but I had such a
        polarizing experience with Outer Wilds' DLC that it's worth pointing
        out. The first hour or two of this 8+-hour DLC was mind-blowing and
        somehow manages to up the ante on what was one of the best games I've
        ever played as is. Unfortunately (for me), it soon devolves into a
        (admittedly well-designed) horror-survival experience, in ways that the
        original game never even came close to being. It was soon obvious to me
        that there was no way I was going to enjoy getting through the
        experience, so I watched a playthrough of it instead. There is so much
        positive to say about this expansion, and there are three distinct "oh
        my gosh" revelations which each one-up the other in ways that are so
        incredible and inspiring and unforgettable. There is absolutely a
        reality where this game could have had a mode without the aspect that
        made it survival-horror, but I do believe I'm the minority in this
        opinion as most online discourse seems to enjoy the specific mechanic I
        felt frustrated by.

        Generally speaking, my criteria for GOTY is pretty loose, although one
        common theme that I personally have noticed is: if by the end of a given
        experience I am thinking "I can't wait to play this again someday" then
        there's a good chance it belongs in this list. This is particularly true
        because I personally very rarely replay games. I also try not to limit
        this list to any specific length (because, well, some years you just
        play a lot of great games), while also trying to resist the temptation
        to just put 15+ games here.

      <p>
        There is way more to say about this game than I could ever conjure into
        words. It really feels like it speaks for itself entirely. Every moment
        is packed with emotion and dripping with style, and it is so consistent
        with itself that it feels almost like it was birthed whole-cloth as a
        single entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city the game takes place in, and the exposed lore of the world that
        this city lives amongst, and all of its people and their place in that
        world all feel so real. Every "quest" you come across never feels as
        such, but just another person in this world living their life and
        integrating you into it in the ways that they feel like doing. It's also
        worth noting that I generally dislike the "amnesia" main protagonist
        trope, but this game builds its entire premise and plot on it which
        makes it feel believable and worthy. It also can't be overstated how
        impactful the soundtrack is in
        <i>Disco Elysium</i>. It is another character in the story and the
        world, it ties everything together, and it makes you feel everything
        Harry feels.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my opinion, this might be one of the best games ever crafted, and it
        will no doubt go down in the annals of history as a seminal classic of
        interactive fiction and creativity. I can't wait to play it again some
        day and explore the hundreds of decisions and options I didn't stumble
        across the first time around.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Returnal</h4>
      <h6>Housemarque</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/returnal-1.gif'" />
      <p>
        I don't think I've ever been as deeply immersed in a game as I was with
        <i>Returnal</i>. From a flow-state gameplay perspective absolutely, but
        also as a can't-stop-thinking-about-it brain worm life feeling
        (coincidentally though, <i>Disco Elysium</i> may be the only other game
        I've ever played that gave me that same feeling). I finished the
        experience across 6 intensely condensed days of playing, and there was
        once that I think I launched and played the game 4 separate times in a
        single day (admittedly for shorter sessions each, but its worth noting
        how unlike me it is to do this). The world immersion and the extreme
        precision and care put into the game design flow itself mostly
        contributed to my not being able to stop thinking about it.
      </p>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/returnal-2.gif'" />
      <p>
        After such wonderful gameplay systems and world design, everything else
        about the game feels like icing on the cake. The particle effect design,
        the ear-candy sound design, the creature models, the
        random-but-not-too-random level generation, and the
        punishing-but-forgiving-enough play loop to name a few. Then it's all
        capped off beautifully by its what-the-hell-is-going-on narrative and
        our main protagonist's great voice work. I didn't get the true "Act 3"
        ending, but I'll likely revisit the game in a few years and see that
        conclusion through.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Mutazione</h4>
      <h6>Die Gute Fabrik</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/mutazione.gif'" />
      <p>
        This game embodies so many of the reasons I play games. Games that allow
        us to escape to different worlds, with their own problems but also their
        own beauties that our own world can't have. Games that let us become
        somebody we aren't (in this case, a teenage girl going on a
        coming-of-age summer vacation trip to an irradiated fallout island full
        of quirky mutated humans...). Games that give us feelings and
        connections we can't otherwise find in our day-to-day lives. Games that
        create a space for us to laugh or cry or think or just be and feel.
        Games that manifest meaning from nothing, carefully weaving together an
        intricate pattern of sound and visual and text with interaction.
        Mutazione accomplishes all of this and so much more, and all with some
        beautifully simple gameplay mechanics.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">"DEATHLOOP"</h4>
      <h6>Arkane Studios</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/deathloop.gif'" />
      <p>
        I expected this game to be much more like "<i>Dishonored</i>
        but with a time-loop" than it ends up being in reality. To be fair, it
        shares so many elements with
        <i>Dishonored</i> , so I can see why I might have thought that. But, the
        entire structure, tone, and even much of the moment-to-moment gameplay,
        is quite different. The DNA though is clearly there, and the level
        design is unquestionably descendent. And let's be honest, the level
        design is the shining star of the <i>Dishonored</i> franchise anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's well established online why everybody thinks so highly of this
        game, and it's all spot on. The world design is distinctive, and the
        cast of characters are quite memorable despite the player interacting
        directly with some of them very infrequently. It all feels so well
        realized and consistent with its bizarre and captivating sci-fi premise.
        My experience overall felt complete, so I may never actually revisit
        this game's campaign, but I loved my time with it and I could see them
        doing some DLC for it which would be a welcome addition.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Manifold Garden</h4>
      <h6>William Chyr Studio</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/manifold-garden.gif'" />
      <p>
        The mind-bending visuals of this game are enough to set it apart from
        many other games, but the puzzle design and bizarre avant-garde approach
        to story telling elevate it further. It's the rare case where I actually
        feel as though I'm playing as myself in this game, as it makes no effort
        to give the game's avatar any story, context, or personality. It's a
        direct connection between me and the game, facilitated through an
        interactive first-person camera control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiencing <i>Manifold Garden</i> gave me the same feeling that you
        might get from an indie film, one that you feel is so quirky or specific
        or meaningful that it could have only been created specifically for you.
        The game expresses itself in such an experimental way, and entirely
        succeeds at making you think about things you never expected to think
        about from a game with no text or explicit narrative.

      <h4 class="bold">Control</h4>
      <h6>Remedy Entertainment</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/control.gif'" />
      <p>
        Jesse is such a well-written character and the world of Control is such
        an interesting blend of so many sci-fi tropes and still emerges as
        something completely distinct. Even a year after playing it, I still
        remember the names of the characters and a lot of the specifics of what
        happens in the story. It also feels like a really meaningful evolution
        of the "documents" and "audio logs" trope that a lot of these games fall
        into; it never feels like those items scattered about are "lore dump"
        but are a very meaningful way of world building. I can't wait to see
        what Remedy does next, although I don't imagine I'll be playing the
        suspense-turned-horror Alan Wake 2, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Diablo II: Resurrected</h4>
      <h6>Blizzard Entertainment, Vicarious Visions</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/diablo-2-resurrected.gif'" />
      <p>
        I played this once through with my brother, and can say that the team
        that Blizzard gave this to for the remastering treatment did great with
        it. I could see going back to this again with others or to play through
        on the harder difficulties. It's fittingly so that the best thing
        Blizzard has put out in quite a while is a remake of their pièce de
        résistance from 20 years ago.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</h4>
      <h6>Insomniac Games</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales.gif'" />
      <p>
        This sequel improved upon everything from the original in my opinion,
        and will go down certainly as the best "launch" title for the PS5
        generation. It felt significantly more focused than the first (as in,
        many less collectibles), which I prefer in general in these open world
        games. More like
        <i>Horizon: Zero Dawn</i> (or <i>Breath of the Wild</i> maybe) and less
        like <i>Assassin's Creed</i> is always what I prefer. The story was just
        as good, and although the game length was much shorter, I almost always
        prefer compact and focused narrative experiences that players can and do
        actually finish.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</h4>
      <h6>Vanillaware</h6>
      <img :src="'./images/gomy2021/13-sentinels-aegis-rim.gif'" />
      <p>
        A truly bizarre and memorable sci-fi experience. The flow between the
        narrative and strategy sections never quite hit the mark for me, but
        overall the writing and the world they create manages to be both
        referential to many Japanese tropes while also feeling fresh and
        self-aware.
