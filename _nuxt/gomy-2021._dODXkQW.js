At the start of the year, I made myself a goal to play 2 indie games per week (or average 2-per-week by the end of the year at least). My definition of indie was loose, but in most cases the games are at least an hour or more in length, generally (but not always) have an &quot;end&quot; state of some sort, and are considered &quot;indie&quot; by the generally accepted definition (not published by a large company, a moderate budget and team size, etc). I achieved the goal just barely, and played 105 total indie games (wow!), although I will say that it didn&#39;t feel like a &quot;difficult&quot; goal to achieve necessarily because of how varied and short the experiences were each week. This gives rise to a &quot;Notable Indies&quot; portion of the list below, which I think will be recurring in future lists. </p><p data-v-b1a6744e> And as a result, I played a good amount less &quot;AAA&quot; games in 2021, which was a necessary trade off. Generally speaking, I prefer indie games anyway, so I don&#39;t feel remorse about this. Below are quick blurbs on the notable experiences I had this year.
